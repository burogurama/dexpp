/** Lossless conversion between DEX string data (MUTF-8) and C++ strings.
 *
 *  DEX strings are sequences of UTF-16 code units, stored as MUTF-8: every
 *  code unit is encoded on its own (1 to 3 bytes), U+0000 is the two bytes
 *  C0 80, and a character above U+FFFF is a surrogate pair — two 3-byte
 *  sequences.  The format allows *unpaired* surrogates in string data.
 *
 *  These functions represent a DEX string as WTF-8: UTF-8, except that an
 *  unpaired surrogate is kept as its 3-byte sequence (ED A0..BF xx).  Every
 *  DEX string converts to exactly one canonical WTF-8 string and back:
 *  supplementary characters are 4-byte UTF-8 sequences, U+0000 is a plain
 *  0x00 byte.  Ordinary text is ordinary UTF-8.
 *
 *  (The analysis layer's `parse_utils::decode_mutf8` is different on purpose:
 *  it replaces unpaired surrogates with U+FFFD so its output is always valid
 *  UTF-8, which Python needs.) */
